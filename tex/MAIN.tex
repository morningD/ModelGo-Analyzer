%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  As model parameter sizes reach the billion-level range and their training consumes zettaFLOPs of computation, components reuse and collaborative development are become increasingly prevalent in the machine learning (ML) community.
  These components, including models, software, and datasets, may originate from various sources and be published under different licenses, which govern the use and distribution of licensed materials and their derivatives.
  However, commonly chosen licenses, such as GPL and Apache, are software-specific and may not be clearly defined and bounded in the context of model publishing.
  Meanwhile, the reused components may also have free-content licenses and model licenses, which pose a potential risk of license conflicts and rights infringement within the model production workflow.
  In this paper, we propose addressing the above challenges along two lines:
    1) For license analysis, we have developed a new vocabulary for ML workflow management and encoded license rules to enable ontological reasoning for analyzing rights granting and license conflicts.
    2) For standardized model publishing, we have drafted a set of model licenses that provide flexible options to meet the diverse needs of model publishing.
    Our analysis tool is built on Turtle language and the Notation 3 reasoning engine, serving as a first step toward Linked Open Model Production Data.
    We have also encoded our proposed model license set into rules and demonstrated the effects of GPL and other commonly used licenses in model publishing, along with the flexibility advantages of our proposed model licenses, through experiments.

\end{abstract}

%. This can expose licensed models to risks that are beyond the publisher's desired control

\begin{comment}
  Productionizing machine learning projects is inherently complex, involving a multitude of interconnected components that are assembled like LEGO blocks and evolve throughout development lifecycle.
  These components encompass software, databases, and models, each subject to various licenses governing their reuse and redistribution.
  However, existing license analysis approaches for Open Source Software (OSS) are not well-suited for this context.
  For instance, some projects are licensed without explicitly granting sublicensing rights, or the granted rights can be revoked, potentially exposing their derivatives to legal risks.
  Indeed, the analysis of licenses in machine learning projects grows significantly more intricate as it involves interactions among diverse types of licenses and licensed materials.
  To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has delved into the exploration of license conflicts within this domain.
  In this paper, we introduce ModelGo, a practical tool for auditing potential legal risks in machine learning projects to enhance compliance and fairness.
  With ModelGo, we present license assessment reports based on five use cases with diverse model-reusing scenarios, rendered by real-world machine learning components.
  Finally, we summarize the reasons behind license conflicts and provide guidelines for minimizing them.
  Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/ModelGo}.
