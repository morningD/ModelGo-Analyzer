\begin{abstract}
As model parameter sizes scale into the billions and training consumes zettaFLOPs of computation, the reuse of Machine Learning (ML) assets and collaborative development have become increasingly prevalent in the ML community.
These ML assets, including models, datasets, and software, may originate from various sources and be published under different licenses, which govern the use and distribution of licensed works and their derivatives.
However, commonly chosen licenses, such as GPL and Apache, are software-specific and are not clearly defined or bounded in the context of model publishing.
Meanwhile, the reused assets may also be under free-content licenses and model licenses, which pose a potential risk of license noncompliance and rights infringement within the model production workflow.
In this paper, we address these challenges along two lines:
1) For ML workflow compliance, we propose a new vocabulary for ML workflow management and encoded license rules to enable ontological reasoning for analyzing rights granting and compliance issues.
2) For standardized model publishing, we introduce a set of model licenses that provide flexible options to meet the diverse needs of the ML community.
Our analysis tool is built on Turtle language and Notation3 reasoning engine, envisioned as a first step toward Linked Open Data for ML workflow management.
We have also encoded our proposed model licenses into rules and demonstrated the effects of GPL and other commonly used licenses in model publishing, along with the flexibility advantages of our licenses, through comparisons and experiments.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Non-standard licensing is prevalent in ML projects, and the underlying risks are often neglected. 
To reveal these risks, we propose formal ontologies for describing ML workflows and develop the MG Analyzer to detect compliance issues based on it. 
To promote more standardized licensing in the future, we have drafted MG Licenses to provide flexible licensing solutions for model publishing. 
Our experiments show that commonly used OSS and CC licenses are unsuitable for model publishing, while MG Licenses provide a viable alternative.
